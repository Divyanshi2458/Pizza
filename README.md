The first step in the recipe is making of the dough. In that first we mix the water and flour to make a thick mixture.After that we add yeast into the mixture and let it sit for 4 to 5 hours.The yeast helps the dough to expand and rise up

In the second step we make the tamato paste.For that we have to blend the tomatoes to make a liquid paste and add seasoning to the paste to add extra flavours.

In the third step we assemble all the ingredients layer by layer and therefore make the Pizza
